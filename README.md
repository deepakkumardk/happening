## UI library

I have chose the [react-native-blossom-ui](https://github.com/deepakkumardk/react-native-blossom-ui), as it's the largest UI library out there with a lot of customization and to ship app faster.

## State Management

I Chose Zustand as it simplify the state management with just store and few lines of code and it's easy to manage.

## Navigation & Routing

Since this is in expo and expo-router comes by default so just use it.

## Styling & Theming

For styling `StyleSheet` is enough, while for theming Blossom-UI done the trick as it comes in dark theme support out of the box.

## Any Performance Optimization

I have cached the user's current location and fetched it only once,and used react memo hook wherever possible.
